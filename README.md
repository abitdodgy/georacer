# Geo Racer

Race your friends anywhere, any time with [GeoRacer.io](https://georacer.io/). The racing game helps you track down waypoints with an interactive hot/cold meter. But beware, your friends will gain hazards along the way that will make your race more difficult. Be the first to collect a courses's waypoint and win the day!

Geo Racer was created by a small mighty [Gaslight](https://teamgaslight.com/) team using [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/) and [LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) for [Phoenix Phrenzy](https://phoenixphrenzy.com)
